## Welcome to the blog!

Hello, and welcome to Silicon Prairie! We'll cover the latest developments in tech, startups, and venture capital happening between the coasts. The blog is sure to evolve over the coming months, but the vision is to post the latest trends in a variety of formats:  
* City and state overviews  
* Weekly funding roundups  
* Analysis of regional VC portfolios
* Interviews with leading founders and investors  
* Announcements for relevant conferences and research initiatives
* And much more!

If you have ideas or see that an area isn't getting proper attention, please [let us know](https://siliconprairie.github.io/contact/). As we grow and iterate on this concept, feedback will be critical!

We hope to give much needed attention to the innovative companies growing across the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, South, and beyond. We're excited to embark on this journey- we hope you enjoy the ride!
